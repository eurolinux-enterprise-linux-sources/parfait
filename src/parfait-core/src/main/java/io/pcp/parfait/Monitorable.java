/**
 * <p>
 * An interface to be implemented by any value that needs to be monitored using
 * the Parfait monitoring system.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An Monitorable primarily exists to return a value on demand (see
 * {@link #get()}) but must also be capable of providing metadata about the
 * semantics of a value so that various output sinks may treat the value
 * appropriately.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Monitors use JSR-363 Unit semantics to define their value scale, however if
 * the output sinks in use do not care about this value, or use it in any
 * meaningful way this may not need to be provided.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is up to the particular {@link Monitor} implementation which uses a given
 * Monitorable to determine whether all Monitorables need to be 'pre-registered'
 * with the Monitor, or if dynamic addition of Monitorables over the lifetime of
 * an application is acceptable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All monitor implementations must support concurrent access from multiple
 * threads.
